## Identifying synthetic lethal (SL) interaction involving poorly represented mutations in cancer cell line panels
Analyses of CRISPR screens in genetically characterised cell line panels can be used to identify vulnerabilities associated with specific mutations, including oncogene addictions and synthetic lethalities. However, typically such approaches can only be used when the mutation in question is well represented in the cell line panel (e.g., > 5 cell lines). Many mutations that are recurrently observed in patient cohorts are poorly represented in existing cancer cell line panels. The goal of this project is to explore computational approaches, e.g., based on outlier statistics, that can be used to identify vulnerabilities associated with mutations that are poorly represented in cell line panels (< 5 cell lines mutated). We will primarily focus on the identification of vulnerabilities involving synthetic lethal interactions between paralog genes.
